## My process

I started this project which is part of the Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele.
During this process of building this website by coding along with Colt, I learned how to build a CRUD application in Express using different packages.
In the first part, I implemented the routes and then I implemented the templates for the webpages.
To store the data I used MongoDB and for the front-end part, I used Bootstrap.
For deploying part I used Render.

### Built with

- Express
- MongoDB
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- EJS
- CSS
- Render

### What I learned

The process of building this web page was a bit challenging, but it helped me to consolidate my knowledges regarding a fullstack web application.
